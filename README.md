# App Details

This is a Cryptocurrency tracking app designed to mirror the functionality of the iphone Stocks app.
A watchlist contains basic information about tracked stocks. Currencies can be added to the watchlist via the search bar
or removed. The watchlist is stored in localStorage so that it is preserved across site visits. If clicked, the user is routed to a page with price plotting ability for various time-intervals, as well as additional
coin metrics. Styling is mostly done using bootstrap, plotting uses plotly.js. Routing comes from react-router.

The site is deployed at this [https://dstern-react-cryptotracker.netlify.app/](https://dstern-react-cryptotracker.netlify.app/)
